# FriendFinder

FriendFinder is an application that matches you with someone  based on your survey answers. All of the user's answers are stored so as more people use it and the pool of available matches increases, better matches are able to be found.


FriendFinder is built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript on the front-end, and Node.js on the backend. The front-end utilizes Bootstrap 4 and JQuery while the back-end uses Express for Node.
