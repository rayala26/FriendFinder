# FriendFinder

FriendFinder is an application that matches you with someone based on your survey answers. It will then take in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

FriendFinder is built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript on the front-end, and Node.js on the backend. The front-end utilizes Bootstrap 4 and JQuery while the back-end uses Express for Node.
